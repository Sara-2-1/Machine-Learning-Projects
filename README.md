# Task 1: Boston Housing Price Prediction

## Project Aim
Predict the median value of owner-occupied homes in Boston using regression techniques.

## Description
This task involves analyzing the Boston Housing dataset, which includes features like crime rate, average number of rooms, and pupil-teacher ratio. The goal is to build predictive models that estimate home prices based on these characteristics, aiding real estate decisions.

## Models Used
- **Linear Regression:** Statistical method to estimate relationships between dependent and independent variables.  
- **Decision Tree:** A model that splits data based on feature values to make predictions.

## Data Preprocessing
- Cleaning the data by handling missing or inaccurate records to ensure model accuracy.

## Dataset
Boston Housing dataset from U.S Census, containing 506 samples with various housing-related features.
